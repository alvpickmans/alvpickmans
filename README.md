## `$ whoami`

The _TL;DR_ is I'm a self-taught developer with a background in architecture and engineering that while working on an architectural studio fell in ‚ù§Ô∏è with coding and automation trying to make my work more effective, less repetitive and in a way more exciting.

I started playing with visual programming tools such as [Dynamo](https://dynamobim.org/) and some [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app/) in my spare time, quickly having a taste of Python üêç to fill the gaps in visual programming to then transition to C#. The architectural software ecosystem is primarily using NET Framework (although recent efforts are being made to modernize to .NET), so these were the right tools. 

During the next few years I grew from _"wft is an interface?"_ to planning system architectures involving distributed services, designing coherent API scpecifications or developing orchestrated, fault-tolerant  infrastructure interacting with thrird party services. But even if that sounds cool, I'm still debating how can I do better?
